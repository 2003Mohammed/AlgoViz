🚀 AlgoViz – Visualize Data Structures & Algorithms Like Never Before


👋 Introduction

Welcome to AlgoViz, your one-stop platform to see how data structures and algorithms actually work.

We all know reading about arrays, linked lists, or Dijkstra’s algorithm in textbooks feels like deciphering ancient scripts. AlgoViz flips the script — instead of walls of text, you get animations, interactive controls, and step-by-step visualizations.

Because let’s face it:
👉 If you can see it, you can learn it.

✨ Features

🎨 Beautiful Visualizations – Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs & more.

⚡ Algorithm Animations – Sorting, Searching, Traversals, and Pathfinding algorithms brought to life.

🌀 Random Example Generators – Generate fresh, real-world-like examples at the click of a button.

⏱️ Speed Control – Slow things down to learn, or speed it up to test your understanding.

📚 Learning Links – Quick access to GeeksforGeeks & W3Schools for deep dives.

🌍 Real-world Applications – Learn where and why these concepts actually matter.

📊 Complexities & Properties – Time, space, and behavior neatly explained for each DS & Algorithm.


🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

•Frontend: React + TypeScript

•Styling: TailwindCSS

•Animations: Framer Motion

•Deployment: Vercel


🚦 Getting Started

Clone and run locally:

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/2003Mohammed/AlgoViz.git

# Navigate into the folder
cd AlgoViz

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev


Your local server should now be running at http://localhost:5173/
 🎉

🌐 Deployment

AlgoViz is hosted on Vercel for a smooth, zero-config deployment experience.


🤔 Why AlgoViz?

•  Because DSA shouldn’t feel boring.

•  Because animations stick in memory longer than plain text.

•  Because you deserve a free, open-source way to practice and learn.

📌 Roadmap

 •  Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues

 •  Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion …)

 •  Trees & Graphs with BFS/DFS

 •  More advanced Graph algorithms (Kruskal, Prim, Floyd-Warshall)

 •  User-created custom inputs for all visualizations

 •  Export/share your visualization as GIFs

💡 Fun Fact

Did you know? Amazon deploys code every 11 seconds. Imagine how much faster you’d learn DSA if you practiced with AlgoViz daily. 😉
